    <h3>Algorithms</h3>
    <p>
      I love solving riddles and problems and building stuff from scratch. My strong suit is that I don't give up without a fight. When trying to find the solution to a problem, I will not quit until I find at least one. The satisfaction I get from solving a problem can really make my day.    </p>

    <h3>Travel</h3>
    <p>
      When I was 19 I traveled by plane for the first time, and after that I was hooked. I went to the United States twice, Surinam, Greece, Malta, the Canary Islands and more. But as much as I love the sun, I also love going to the Alps for some snowboarding.    </p>
